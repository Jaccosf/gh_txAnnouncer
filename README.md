# Ghostscripts txAnnouncer

Because I didn't find any [txAdmin](https://txadm.in) announcers at the Forums I decided to create this simple one. In the shared.lua you can freely change the notification to the one you like. For the language you have to go into the Server file.

You can find the Notification I used here: [t-notify](https://github.com/TasoOneAsia/t-notify)
