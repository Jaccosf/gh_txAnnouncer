# Ghostscripts txAnnouncer

Because I didn't find any [txAdmin](https://txadm.in) announcers at the Forums I decided to create this simple one. In the *shared.lua* file you can freely change the notification to the one you like. If you want to change the language you'll need to go into the *server.lua* file.

You can find the Notification I used here: [t-notify](https://github.com/TasoOneAsia/t-notify)
